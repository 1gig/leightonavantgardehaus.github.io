AIM implements a systematic mechanism of monitoring customer and investigator satisfaction across a range of items. This initiative is very important to us as we nurture relationships with our clients to address potential issues well in advance and ensure continuous improvement in our services. We have observed excellent levels of satisfaction in general and especially on items such as communication and project team quality.
