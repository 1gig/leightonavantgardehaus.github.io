# Intelligence  

Artificial intelligence (AI) promises to revolutionize data management and analytics for government by automating ingest and handling, amplifying human intelligence, and transforming decision-making and outcome efficacy. But adoption remains difficult, as many government agencies are facing data complexity roadblocks, shortages of data scientists and AI experts and a lack of low-cost, readily deployable technologies. 


If your agency is struggling with these challenges, Leighton AgH can help. Our data science expertise, open-architecture solution stack and integration know-how can federate and centrally organize your data and then operationalize AI-driven analytics from it with greater ease. Leverage a full life-cycle solution or integrate in increments into existing systems as your transformation journey and resources allow: 

ICD Data Platform, featuring zero-trust and attribute-based access controls that enable data co-location 

Leighton  IQX,  our low-code rapid-development environment for AI and analytic models 

 

Leighton IQX, our pre-built algorithms and AI models specially designed for a variety of private sector, government, or large scale mission needs. 

The path to AI and knowledge transformation is especially tough if you're a resource-constrained organization facing technical hurdles. Leighton AgH and AIM DYNAMIX, a Leighton AgH company, have the experts and solutions to elevate your data and empower the people and resources you have to achieve data-driven decision-making for your mission.
Our solutions improve decision-making, enhance readiness, and elevate outcomes in critical missions.

Innovating Immersive Technologies 


Leighton AgH' immersive technologies augment the ways people interact with tasks and information. Advanced synthetic environments, or computer representations of the real world, provide new ways for people to learn and gather information, while systems adapt to learners based off biometric human performance and analytic feedback.

We integrate systems of systems to accelerate understanding of complex concepts in training, experimentation, and prototyping by leveraging artificial intelligence, machine learning, digital engineering, software, human performance, and biometrics.


Leighton Avant-Garde Haus drives applied science and intersects it with policy and operations expertise to make a difference in national and global security matters. Our people in engineering and integration, advanced analytics, training, and program management integrate capabilities across disciplines in proven and innovative ways to achieve one common objective: customer mission success
